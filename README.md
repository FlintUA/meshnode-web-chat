# Core Features

MeshCenter combines several independent subsystems into one control center. Each subsystem is designed to be useful on its own, but together they turn a Raspberry Pi into a practical Meshtastic base station.

---

## 💬 Messaging

MeshCenter provides a browser-based chat interface for Meshtastic communication.

The messaging system supports both public channel messages and direct node-to-node messages.

### Public Channel

Public messages are sent to the configured Meshtastic channel, usually LongFast channel index `0`.

Typical use cases:

- Local mesh chat
- Community messages
- Field communication
- Test messages
- Sensor status announcements

### Direct Messages

MeshCenter also supports direct messages between nodes.

Direct messages are shown as separate chats, making it easier to work with multiple known nodes from a browser interface.

### Messaging Features

- Public channel messaging
- Direct node-to-node messaging
- Chat history
- Automatic message refresh
- Message timestamps
- Favorite chats

---

## 📡 Node Management

MeshCenter automatically discovers nodes from the Meshtastic mesh and stores them locally.

The node list helps you understand what devices are visible in your area and when they were last heard.

### Node Information

Depending on the available data, MeshCenter can display:

- Long name
- Short name
- Node ID
- Hardware model
- Role
- Last seen time
- RSSI
- SNR
- Hop distance
- Last message

### Favorites

Frequently used nodes can be marked as favorites.

Favorites are useful for:

- Your own devices
- Family nodes
- Field team nodes
- Known repeaters
- Important contacts

### Ignore List

Nodes that are not relevant can be ignored.

Ignored nodes remain in the database, but they can be hidden from the main view and filtered out from normal interaction.

This is useful in busy areas where many nodes are visible but only a few are important for your setup.

### Import and Export

MeshCenter supports importing and exporting the local node database.

This is useful for:

- Backups
- Moving to another Raspberry Pi
- Keeping a known node list
- Sharing node information between installations

---

## 📈 Telemetry

MeshCenter displays telemetry received from Meshtastic devices and stores historical telemetry locally.

Telemetry is useful for monitoring both the radio node and connected sensors.

### Device Telemetry

Supported device telemetry includes:

- Battery level
- Voltage
- Channel utilization
- Air utilization
- Uptime
- Last update time

### Environmental Telemetry

This makes it possible to observe long-term changes such as:

- Temperature trends
- Humidity changes
- Pressure changes
- Battery voltage
- Current consumption
- Power usage

---

## 📷 Camera

MeshCenter includes camera support based on Raspberry Pi Camera and Picamera2.

The camera subsystem is designed for lightweight live viewing and photo capture on low-power hardware.

### Live Video

Live video is provided as an MJPEG stream.

MJPEG is not the most bandwidth-efficient video format, but it has excellent browser compatibility and works reliably without additional client-side software.

### Photo Capture

MeshCenter can capture high-resolution photos and store them locally.

The application can use different settings for:

- Live preview
- Video mode
- Photo capture

This allows the system to keep the live view lightweight while still supporting full-resolution image capture.

### Camera Settings

Depending on the connected camera, MeshCenter can support:

- Video resolution
- Photo resolution
- FPS
- JPEG quality
- Preview size
- Save size

### Gallery

Captured images are saved locally and can be viewed through the browser interface.

The gallery is useful for:

- Field observations
- Remote monitoring
- Simple documentation
- Weather station photos
- Project logs

---

## 🖼️ Photo Gallery

MeshCenter stores captured photos inside the local data directory.

The gallery provides browser-based access to saved images without requiring SSH or file browser access to the Raspberry Pi.

Typical use cases:

- Checking recent camera captures
- Reviewing field images
- Downloading saved photos
- Keeping a visual project log

Screenshots and captured photos are stored locally and are not transmitted through Meshtastic.

---

## ⚙️ Local Storage

MeshCenter stores application data locally using JSON files.

This keeps the project simple and easy to inspect, backup and repair.

Typical stored files include:

```text
messages.json
nodes.json
chats.json
sensors.json
telemetry_history.json
deleted_dm.json
screenshots/
```

Local storage is useful because:

- no external database is required
- backups are easy
- files can be inspected manually
- the system remains lightweight
- the installation stays simple

---

## 🧩 Modular Architecture

MeshCenter is gradually moving from a single large server file to a modular architecture.

Current modules include:

```text
api/
camera/
meshsrv/
storage/
telemetry/
utils/
```

This makes the project easier to maintain and extend.

The goal is to keep `server.py` as the central coordinator while moving specialized logic into dedicated modules.

---

# Camera Notes

Camera support depends on Raspberry Pi system packages.

If the camera does not work inside the virtual environment, make sure that the environment was created with:

```bash
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv
```

Without this option, Python inside the virtual environment may not see system packages such as:

- Picamera2
- Pillow
- libcamera-related bindings

To test camera imports:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
try:
    from picamera2 import Picamera2
    print("Picamera2 OK")
except Exception as e:
    print("Picamera2 ERROR:", e)

try:
    from PIL import Image
    print("Pillow OK")
except Exception as e:
    print("Pillow ERROR:", e)
PY
```

---

# Recommended Camera Settings

For Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, conservative camera settings are recommended.

| Setting | Recommended |
|---|---|
| Video Resolution | 640 × 480 or 800 × 600 |
| FPS | 8-15 |
| JPEG Quality | 70-85 |
| Photo Preview | 640 × 480 |
| Photo Capture | 2592 × 1944 |

Higher settings may work, but they increase CPU usage, memory usage and heat.

---

# Recommended Raspberry Pi Zero 2W Usage

Raspberry Pi Zero 2W is powerful enough for MeshCenter, but it has limited resources.

For best stability:

- avoid unnecessarily high video FPS
- avoid very high JPEG quality for live video
- keep browser polling intervals reasonable
- use a reliable power supply
- use a good microSD card
- keep the enclosure ventilated
- monitor CPU temperature during long camera sessions

MeshCenter is designed to remain lightweight, but camera streaming and photo capture can still temporarily increase system load.

# Project Structure

MeshCenter has been designed as a modular application. Each subsystem has its own responsibility, making the project easier to maintain, debug and extend.

# Application Architecture

MeshCenter consists of several independent modules that work together.

```
                    Web Browser
                          │
                          │ HTTP
                          ▼
                   Flask Application
                          │
     ┌──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
     │              │              │              │
     ▼              ▼              ▼              ▼
 Messaging      Camera        Telemetry      REST API
     │              │              │
     └──────────────┼──────────────┘
                    ▼
             Meshtastic CLI
                    │
                    ▼
             LoRa Radio Device
```

The browser never communicates directly with the Meshtastic node. All communication is handled by the Flask application, which coordinates the different subsystems.

---

# Data Storage

MeshCenter intentionally avoids using an SQL database.

Instead, all application data is stored as JSON files.

Advantages of this approach:

- No database server required
- Easy backups
- Human-readable files
- Simple migration between Raspberry Pi devices
- Easy recovery after unexpected shutdowns

Typical stored files include:

```
messages.json
nodes.json
chats.json
telemetry_history.json
deleted_dm.json
sensors.json
```

Future versions may optionally support SQLite for installations with very large datasets, but JSON storage will remain the default.

---

# REST API

MeshCenter exposes a REST API used by the browser interface.

Examples of available endpoints include:

```
GET    /api/chats
GET    /api/messages
POST   /api/send

GET    /api/telemetry
GET    /api/sensors

GET    /api/camera/status
GET    /api/camera/frame

GET    /api/base_status
GET    /api/nodes

POST   /api/photo
```

The API is primarily intended for the built-in web interface, but it also allows future integrations with third-party applications.

---

# Performance

MeshCenter has been optimized for Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.

Typical resource usage depends on the enabled features.

Approximate values during normal operation:

| Feature | CPU | RAM |
|----------|----:|----:|
| Idle | Very Low | Low |
| Messaging | Low | Low |
| Telemetry | Low | Low |
| Camera Preview | Medium | Medium |
| Photo Capture | High (short peak) | Medium |

Live MJPEG streaming is currently the most resource-intensive component.

---

# Security

MeshCenter is intended for trusted local networks.

Current security model:

- Local network access
- No cloud dependency
- No external database
- Local JSON storage
- Local camera storage

If remote access is required, it is recommended to use a VPN or another secure tunnel instead of exposing the web interface directly to the Internet.

Future versions may include optional authentication.

---

# Troubleshooting

## Meshtastic CLI not found

Check that the CLI is installed:

```bash
which meshtastic
```

Verify the configured path in `config.py`.

---

## Radio not detected

Verify that the device is connected:

```bash
ls /dev/ttyACM*
```

Test communication:

```bash
meshtastic --info
```

---

## Camera not working

Verify that Picamera2 is available:

```bash
python -c "from picamera2 import Picamera2"
```

If the import fails, recreate the virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv
```

---

## Service does not start

Check the service status:

```bash
systemctl status meshcenter
```

View the logs:

```bash
journalctl -u meshcenter -f
```

---

## High CPU usage

Possible causes:

- High MJPEG frame rate
- Large preview resolution
- High JPEG quality
- Multiple browser clients
- Background image processing

Reducing camera settings usually has the greatest impact.

---

## Messages are not delivered

Verify:

- Same LoRa region
- Same channel
- Same PSK
- Compatible firmware versions
- Target node is reachable

Use the Meshtastic CLI to verify that communication works outside MeshCenter.

---

## Browser cannot connect

Verify that Flask is listening:

```bash
ss -tln
```

Default port:

```
5000
```

Also check your firewall configuration.
