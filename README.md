# 📦 Installation

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlintUA/flint-meshtastic-web-ui.git
cd flint-meshtastic-web-ui
```

## Create a Python Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Install Camera Support

For Raspberry Pi Camera support install:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-picamera2 python3-pil
```

Verify that the camera is working:

```bash
rpicam-hello
```

If the preview starts correctly, the camera is ready.

---

# ⚙️ Configuration

Before starting the application, edit:

```bash
nano config.py
```

---

## Local Node Settings

Specify your local Meshtastic node.

Example:

```python
LOCAL_NODE_ID = "!067a40fa"
LOCAL_NODE_NAME = "Flint Base"
```

To find your Node ID:

```bash
meshtastic --info
```

Look for something similar to:

```text
"!067a40fa"
```

---

## Meshtastic CLI

Set the path to your Meshtastic CLI executable.

Example:

```python
MESHTASTIC_CMD = "/home/flint/.local/bin/meshtastic"
```

Verify:

```bash
which meshtastic
```

---

## USB Serial Port

Specify the serial device connected to your Meshtastic node.

Example:

```python
MESHTASTIC_PORT = "/dev/ttyACM0"
```

Useful commands:

```bash
lsusb
```

```bash
ls -l /dev/ttyACM*
```

Typical output:

```text
Bus 001 Device XXX:
Adafruit WisCore RAK4631 Board
```

---

## Data Directory

Application data are stored locally.

Example:

```python
DATA_DIR = "/home/flint/mesh_web/data"
```

Files created automatically:

```text
messages.json
nodes.json
chats.json
sensors.json
telemetry_history.json
deleted_dm.json
screenshots/
```

---

## Known Nodes (Optional)

You can assign friendly names to frequently used nodes.

Example:

```python
KNOWN_NODES = {
    "!067a40fa": "Flint Base",
    "!b0f14d2a": "Flint Echo",
    "!756f9960": "Flint TAP2",
    "!1fa065f0": "Elektroniker"
}
```

Additional information may also be defined:

```python
KNOWN_NODE_INFO = {
    "!067a40fa": {
        "short_name": "FLTB",
        "hw_model": "RAK4631"
    }
}
```

This section is optional but greatly improves the user interface.

# ⚠️ Current Limitations

This project is still under active development.

Known limitations include:

- Communication currently relies on the Meshtastic CLI.
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2W has limited CPU and memory resources.
- High-resolution photo capture temporarily increases system load.
- MJPEG provides excellent browser compatibility but is not the most bandwidth-efficient streaming format.
- Camera, telemetry and serial communication share limited system resources.

For best performance on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W the recommended camera settings are:

| Setting | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| Video Resolution | 640 × 480 |
| FPS | 8–12 |
| JPEG Quality | 70–80 |
| Photo Preview | 640 × 480 |
| Photo Capture | 2592 × 1944 |
